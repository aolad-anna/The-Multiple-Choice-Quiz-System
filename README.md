**User Category:**

There is one type of User here. It is:

- Student

**Feature List:**

In this project the &quot;Student&quot; has the following features:

- The student can sign in (Registration) to the System.
- They can login to the System and participate the Quiz.
- They can see their total Marks after completion.
- Can choose the subject they want to give quiz.

1. BANGLADESH 2. TECHNOLOGY

3. SPORTS 4. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ï‚·They can participate in multiple subjects, for this has to login again.

- A student can be deleted as well as a question can be updated by the database table.
- They can &quot;Skip&quot; one question &amp; no negative marking.
- They can come back to the Question which they did not answer earlier by &quot; Prev&quot; Button. And go to the next question of the category by &quot;Next&quot; button.
- The Students can keep an eye on the clock because, a clock is added to all the frames of the questions to make the students aware of the time remaining.

**Impact of this Project:**

The students can participate in the quiz and test their knowledge. However, the teachers can give this sort of software among the students and take their quiz. That may help in the country&#39;s education system as education is the parameter of a nation&#39;s development.

Also, if we are capable of enabling the teachers to add the questions making a significant &#39;slot&#39; for them to add and replace questions, this software can be used broadly in the educational institutes.

Thus, this may help in the education, society proportionately as it can make a massive revolution in the nation&#39;s economy as a consequence.

**Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:**

Could not make the User of a teacher who can see the Students marks and give comments/remarks for time limits. So, no data table for a teacher / observer was created in the code. In future, we want to settle that as well.

Also, we want to store or save the obtained marks of a Student in the database and she/ he can see that beside the name.

Also, we had a vision of developing a class that will show the clock in the frame and it will be set to a time bound. Then, the user may not be able to continue the exam if the time finishes. The clock will be always visible. But, in the end we managed it by the directions and order of our honorable course teacher.

The students can see their marks after the exam. But, they cannot see their previous quiz marks here. Also has to login again if they want to participate in another category of quiz.

In future we want to add more features and functionalities to the system and that may help the students who want to testify their knowledge.
